In my Database Management class, I worked with others to create a working database using MariaDB. Our databases goal was to provide the user with a software to assist them in finding a job. The user has various routes to go for their search; from location to responsibilities, to specific needs/dislikes for the desired position. More information is viewable within the Final Report document, including our design phase, ER diagram, relational models, and final implementation. The software works as intended to search through a Kaggle dataset with 23 Columns and 1 Million+ rows. Unfortunately, I could not provide the working exe file as it only works on specific Whitewater campus wifi, VPN login, and computers with the MariaDB software properly installed.
